# Personal project: Sedona

**Porfolio project. Technologies used: Less, Node.js, Gulp.**
**My purpose here was to demonstrate my skill in adaptive design of the front end, and in the use of the above tools.**

I wrote the HTML and did the styling using Less based on Figma mockup of the pages. I did that as part of a front-end training course run by HTML Academy.
They are a great online bootcamp run by exceptional people (at least that was how it was several years ago before the war started and so many things began to crumble and fall apart).

Gulp and Node scripts, and the linting rules were provided by HTML Academy.

The content of the project is a static website which includes several pages promoting the town of Sedona, which is located in the U.S. and is a popular tourist destination.
The main feature of this portfolio project is adaptive design implemented through the use of media queries.

**One more thing** this project is featuring is the use of ***AWS***. it ***serves video and images*** from ***Amazon S3 Bucket*** via ***Amazon Cloudfront***.
